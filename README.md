# TidyTextMining-Python

## Summary

Code snippets from ["Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach"](http://tidytextmining.com/)
[(Github)](https://github.com/dgrtwo/tidy-text-mining)
by Julia Silge and David Robinson, translated into Python.


## What's going on here?

As I read through the book, I'm translating the code samples into Python 3.
As far as I know, there's no Python equivalent to the `tidytext` R package.
I'll be using `pandas` and `SpaCy` (possibly `gensim` also?) to accomplish
the same effects. Let's see how far we get.

**Status:** I'm at the very beginning, Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format.
